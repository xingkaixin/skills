# First-Time Setup

## Overview

When no EXTEND.md is found, guide user through preference setup.

**⛔ BLOCKING OPERATION**: This setup MUST complete before ANY other workflow steps. Do NOT:
- Ask about reference images
- Ask about content/article
- Ask about dimensions (type, palette, rendering)
- Proceed to content analysis

ONLY ask the questions in this setup flow, save EXTEND.md, then continue.

## Setup Flow

```
